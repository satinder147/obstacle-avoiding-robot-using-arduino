/*HELLO EVERYBODY I AM SATINDER SINGH
I MADE THIS ROBOT IN A WEEKEND
IF YOU HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ARDUIINO YOU CAN ALOS MAKE THIS ROBOT WITHIN FEW HOURS
******I FIXED MY SERVO IN SUCH A MANNER SUCH THAT 180 DEGREE ANGLE OF MY SERVO LIES IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT POSITION IS AT ZERO DEGREE******
YOU CAN ALWAYS WATCH THE VIDEO OF THIS PROJECT ON MY CHANNEL REACTOR SCIENCE(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVu2Ie45Bh89lpdg7ezdMyg)
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE CODE BETTER IF YOU SEE THE VIDEO OF THEIS PROJECT CAREFULLY

THE CONNECTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS(ALL  MY PINS ON THE SHIELD ARE CONNECTED TO CORRESPONDING PINS ON THE ARDUINO)
MY SERVO WENT INTO PIN 11 OF MY SHIELD
INFRARED SENSOR ON PIN 3
PIN 8,6 12 ARE FOR MY RIGHT MOTOR
PIN 4 ,7,5 ARE FOR MY LEFT MOTOR
THE CODE IS ALMOST SELF EXPLANATORY
